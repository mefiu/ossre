Open source system for requirements elicitation

What is our goal?
To create an open source tool, using ZKoss framework,
that will provide a web platform for project managers, developers
and their clients to work and cooperate on requirements.
We see a lack of such a tool, free to the public,
that will allow small and medium companies to enter into
the world of web-based software-requirements-specification
cooperation and easy document preparation.

What are the main features of the software we'll build?
* Requirements elicitation,
* Requirements editing,
* Notes and comments collection,
* Requirements' change tracking,
* Documents exportable to various formats: HTML, PDF and MSOOXML (with Apache POI),
* Clear and responsive UI, provided by ZKoss,
* ZKoss' 'desktop feel' when interacting with lists, menus, forms,
* ZKoss' nice and quick ajax-feel when editing document chapters, adding notes,
* Spring security with fine granularity of access rights,
* Interchangeable database layer.

What is the technology of our choice?
* ZKoss,
* Spring,
* Hibernate.
